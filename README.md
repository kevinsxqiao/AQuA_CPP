# AQuA_CPP
The C++ version of AQuA
AQuA (Astrocyte Quantification and Analysis) is a tool to detect signaling events from microscopic time-lapse imaging data of astrocytes or other cell types. The algorithm is data-driven and based on machine learning principles, so, potentially, it can be applied across model organisms, fluorescent indicators, experimental modes, cell types, and imaging resolutions and speeds.
